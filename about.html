            <h2 class="special">Artist Bio</h2>
            <p>I’m an artist who loves creating cute and expressive characters inspired by vtubers, anime girls, and the
                quiet beauty of everyday emotions. My works often focus on warmth and charm, using soft colors, gentle
                lighting, and relaxed compositions to capture a sense of comfort. I find joy in illustrating moments
                that feel familiar and sincere, where even a small smile or shy gesture can tell a story. I want my art
                to give people the same cozy feeling I get when drawing or watching the shows that inspire me.
                <br><br>
                My inspiration mainly comes from anime that highlight emotion and simplicity, especially Bocchi the
                Rock! which taught me how small, heartfelt expressions can leave a big impact. I see art as more than
                visuals—it’s a way to express mood, personality, and kindness. Through my work, I hope to create a soft
                world that reflects both my imagination and my emotions, something people can relate to and find warmth
                in.
            </p>

            <h2 class="special">Creative Process</h2>
            <p>TMy creative process always starts with a simple spark of inspiration—a color, an expression, or an
                emotion that I want to capture. I begin with rough sketches, focusing on mood and feeling before I
                refine the details. Each artwork is built layer by layer, guided by the emotion I want the viewer to
                feel. I take my time adjusting light, texture, and color until the character feels alive and genuine.
                For me, the most important part is making sure every piece communicates something honest.
                <br><br>
                When working in Blender, I treat my 3D projects the same way I approach my illustrations. I enjoy
                building small, cute scenes like my donut render, Pokémon-inspired work, or the cinema booth from Bocchi
                the Rock!—each one has its own tone and story. I also love designing emotes because they challenge me to
                express feelings through small, simple details. No matter the medium, my goal is to create something
                that feels soft, sincere, and comforting, while showing how even the simplest art can make someone’s day
                brighter.</p>
